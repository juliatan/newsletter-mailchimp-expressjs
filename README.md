# Simple newsletter signup landing page

This is a project I've written from scratch to practice Express JS.

This project involves using a [Bootstrap template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/sign-in/) as the newsletter signup landing page. Upon submitting the form, the user's details gets saved to a Mailchimp newsletter account via the [Mailchimp API](https://mailchimp.com/developer/api/).

## Requirements

  - `node`
  - `express`
